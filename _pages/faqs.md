	<h4>What is cancer</h4>
<p>Cancer is the uncontrolled and uncoordinated growth of body cells which invade surrounding normal tissues and might spread to distant organs if not checked in time</p>
<h4>Why does cancer occur</h4>
<p>Cancer is caused by damage to the DNA (genetic material) within our cells. Damage to the DNA happens in all normal cells, but the majority of this damage is repaired by our own body. Sometimes this damage is not repaired properly, which can lead to changes in the properties of the cell (for example cells may acquire the ability to grow and divide rapidly). Accumulated DNA damage can eventually lead to cancer</p>
<h4>Is cancer an infection caused by a germ or bacteria</h4>
<p>Cancer per-say is not an infection. However, long-term infection with some pathogens can cause cancer. For example, infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus can cause liver cancer, and persistent infection of gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori can cause stomach cancer. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) has been linked with lymphomas, nasopharyngeal cancers and some stomach cancers. However, most people infected with these cancer-causing pathogens never develop cancer</p>
<h4>Are people with poor health prone to develop cancer</h4>
<p>Cancer can affect physically fit individuals as well as individuals in poor health. People who are very immunocompromised (e.g. individuals infected with HIV, or on immunosuppressive therapy) have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancers. However, most cancers are caused by a combination of factors that may include tobacco use, alcohol use, your genetic makeup, poor diet, physical inactivity, being overweight, and exposure to chemicals</p>
<h4>Can tobacco, smoking and pan chewing cause cancer</h4>
<p>Yes, smoking a cigarette, beedi, hookah, pipe or cigar increases your chance of getting cancers, some of them being preventable. Eating pan with tobacco and chewing tobacco increases your chance of getting cancers of the head and neck (mouth, lips, nose and sinuses, voice box, throat), esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, uterus, cervix, colon, rectum, ovary and acute myeloid leukemia (blood cancer)</p>
<h4>Can alcohol abuse lead to cancer</h4>
<p>Studies have shown that people who drink alcohol are more likely to get mouth cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, bowel cancer, and throat cancer, which includes pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer and cancer of the food pipe (oesophagus)</p>
<h4>Can emotional stress cause cancer</h4>
<p>No. Emotional stress alone has not been proven as a cause for cancer. However, prolonged stress may affect your overall health status and your ability to cope with cancer</p>
<h4>What are some of the symptoms and warning signs of cancer</h4>
<ul>
<li> A change in bowel or bladder habits</li>
<li>A sore that doesn’t heal</li>
<li>Unusual bleeding or discharge from any opening in the body</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite</li>
<li>Difficulty in swallowing or chronic indigestion</li>
<li>An obvious change in a wart or mole</li>
<li>A nagging cough or persistent hoarseness of voice</li>
</ul>
<h4>How can we protect ourselves from cancer</h4>
<p>If we take care of the following, we can reduce the risk of getting cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness regarding healthy lifestyle (e.g. avoid tobacco, limit alcohol intake, maintain a health body weight).</li>
<li>Awareness of warning signs and symptoms of cancers</li>
<li>Regular health checkups</li>
<li>Undergo recommended screening for cancers</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does cancer spread</h4>
<p>Cancer can spread in different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>It may directly invade the neighbouring tissues.</li>
<li>Cancerous cells may enter the lymphatic stream and be carried to lymph nodes.</li>
<li>Cancer cells may also pass through the blood stream to other parts of the body</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can it spread from one person to another</h4>
<p>Cancer is not infectious, and cannot spread from one person to another</p>
<h4>Can cancer be diagnosed early</h4>
<p>Yes. Some cancers can be diagnosed early if the patient is aware of the warning symptoms and consults a health care provider in time. Cancers that have been diagnosed and treated early have a better survival than those treated in advanced stages</p>
<h4>Can cancer be completely cured</h4>
<p>Yes, early detection and treatment can lead to the complete cure of some cancers. Many cancer patients can return to their normal life activities during the treatment also</p>
